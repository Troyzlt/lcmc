# ENABLE ulimit core dumps
# 
# On Debian systems, the creation of core dump files is disabled
# by default to avoid file system overflowing. However, as this
# software is rather new and there might still me glitches and
# problems with it, having OpenAIS coredumps might be useful to
# ease the struggles of debugging. Setting the following option
# to 1 enables core dump file creation for OpenAIS.
